# üö® Quick Fix for .htaccess Error

## The Problem
cPanel's Node.js selector is looking for `/home/sedafzgt/public_html/.htaccess` but the file doesn't exist.

## üîß Simple Solution

**Option 1: Create the file via SSH/Terminal**
```bash
# SSH to your server and run:
touch /home/sedafzgt/public_html/.htaccess
chmod 644 /home/sedafzgt/public_html/.htaccess
```

**Option 2: Create via cPanel File Manager**
1. Open cPanel ‚Üí File Manager
2. Navigate to `/public_html/`
3. Create New File ‚Üí `.htaccess`
4. Copy the content from `htaccess_for_public_html` file

**Option 3: Upload the file**
1. Download the `htaccess_for_public_html` file I created
2. Rename it to `.htaccess`
3. Upload it to `/home/sedafzgt/public_html/.htaccess`

## üìù File Content
The `.htaccess` file should contain:

```apache
# Simple .htaccess file for /home/sedafzgt/public_html/
# This file is required by cPanel Node.js selector to manage environment variables

# Enable HTTPS redirect
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# Basic security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>

# Set proper MIME types
<IfModule mod_mime.c>
    AddType application/javascript .js
    AddType text/css .css
    AddType application/json .json
</IfModule>

# Prevent access to sensitive files
<Files ~ "^\.">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>
```

## ‚úÖ After Creating the File

1. **Restart your Node.js app** in cPanel
2. **Test the endpoints**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://sedap.info/
   curl -I https://sedap.info/api/health
   ```

## üéØ Why This Happens

cPanel's Node.js selector automatically manages environment variables by modifying the `.htaccess` file in your `public_html` directory. If the file doesn't exist, it throws this error.

The file I created is minimal and safe - it just provides the structure cPanel needs while adding basic security features.

**Just create this file and your Node.js app should start working properly! üöÄ**
