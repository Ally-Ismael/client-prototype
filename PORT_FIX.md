# 🔧 Port Configuration Fix for cPanel

## 🔍 Current Status
Your Node.js app is **running successfully** but on **localhost:3001**. The issue is the host/port configuration for cPanel.

## ✅ Your App is Working
The logs show:
- ✅ Application started successfully
- ✅ Database connected to MariaDB
- ✅ All endpoints ready
- ❌ Running on localhost:3001 (not accessible externally)

## 🛠️ Fix the Host/Port Configuration

### Step 1: Check Current cPanel Settings
In cPanel Node.js Selector, check:
- **Port**: Should be set by cPanel (usually 3000 or auto-assigned)
- **App URL**: sedap.info/
- **Environment**: production

### Step 2: Check What Port cPanel Expects
```bash
# Check what port cPanel assigned:
echo $PORT
env | grep PORT

# Check if cPanel set any environment variables:
env | grep -i node
env | grep -i app
```

### Step 3: Fix the Port Issue
The problem might be that your app is hardcoded to port 3001. Let's check:

```bash
cd /home/sedafzgt/nodeapp
grep -n "3001" server.js
grep -n "PORT" server.js
```

## 🔧 Probable Solutions

### Solution 1: Let cPanel Set the Port
Your server.js should use `process.env.PORT` (which cPanel sets) instead of defaulting to 3001.

Current code probably has:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
```

This should work, but cPanel might not be setting the PORT environment variable properly.

### Solution 2: Check if App is Binding to 0.0.0.0
The app might be binding only to localhost. Check if server.js has:

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    // This makes it accessible externally
});
```

### Solution 3: cPanel Port Configuration
In cPanel Node.js Selector:
1. **Stop** the application
2. **Check/Update** the port setting (or leave it auto)
3. **Start** the application
4. Check what port it actually assigned

## 🧪 Test Commands

Run these to diagnose the port issue:

```bash
# Check what's actually listening
netstat -tulnp | grep node
netstat -tulnp | grep 3001

# Check if port 3000 or other ports are in use
netstat -tulnp | grep 3000
netstat -tulnp | grep :80
netstat -tulnp | grep :443

# Check cPanel environment variables
printenv | grep -i port
printenv | grep -i node
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Fix

The issue is probably that:
1. **cPanel expects the app on a different port** (not 3001)
2. **App is only listening on localhost** (not externally accessible)
3. **cPanel isn't setting PORT environment variable** properly

### Quick Fix Attempt:
```bash
# Try starting with a different port
cd /home/sedafzgt/nodeapp
PORT=3000 node server.js

# Or try with explicit host binding:
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=3000 node server.js
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Check what port cPanel assigned** in the Node.js Selector interface
2. **Verify the app is binding to 0.0.0.0** (externally accessible)
3. **Make sure PORT environment variable** is being set correctly
4. **Test with the correct port** that cPanel expects

**The app is working perfectly - it's just a port/host configuration issue! 🚀**
